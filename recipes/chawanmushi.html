        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken breast meat x 85g (deboned and skinned)</li>
            <li>Sake x 1tbsp</li>
            <li>Soy sauce x 2tbsp</li>
            <li>Eggs x 4</li>
            <li>Cold dashi x 2.5cups</li>
            <li>Mirin x 2tsp</li>
            <li>Shiitake mushrooms x 2 (halved)</li>
            <li>Kamaboko x 4 thin slices</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the chicken into eight pieces and marinate for 15 minutes in the sake and 1 tbsp of soy sauce. Drain.</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs and add the dashi, remaining soy sauce, mirin, and salt. Strain through cheesecloth or a fine sieve. Try to avoid making bubbles.</li>
            <li>Distribute marinated chicken, mushrooms, and fishcake among four custard cups (or ramekins).<br>
                Pour the strained egg-dashi mixture over it until the custard cups are almost full.<br>
                If there are any bubbles, prick them with a toothpick.</li>
            <li>Preheat a steamer. Cover the cups with plastic wrap and steam for 15-20 minutes over medium heat.<br>
                Check doneness by sticking a toothpick through the center; if egg sticks to the toothpick, continue steaming for a few more minutes.<br>
                The top of the custard should be smooth and jiggle slightly if touched.</li>
            <li>When done, remove the plastic wrap and serve.</li>
        </ol>
