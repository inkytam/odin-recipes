        <h2>Warmth in a Bowl</h2>
        <p>This dish is my all-time favourite!<br>
        Works well as a celebratory dish, a pick-me-up, or a simple dinner dish.<br>
        Can't go wrong with chewy udon noodles soaked in a warm curry broth, with potatoes, carrots and maybe an egg as well!</p>
