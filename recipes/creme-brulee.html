        <h2>Creamy and Light</h2>
        <p>This dessert is simple and clean, and delish to boot!<br>
        It's my go to whenever I have a little more time for something extra after dinner.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Whole milk x 240ml</li>
            <li>Heavy cream x 720ml</li>
            <li>Vanilla bean x 1 (split)</li>
            <li>Granulated sugar x 210g</li>
            <li>Egg yolks x 10</li>
            <li>(For caramelizing) Granulated sugar x 67g</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 162.5 Celsius.</li>
            <li>Heat milk, cream, and vanilla bean in a medium saucepan over med-high heat until it reaches a slow boil.<br>
                Remove from heat when bubbles appear along sides of pan. Allow to cool for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a medium-sized bowl, quickly whisk sugar with egg yolks. Slowly pour cream into egg yolk mixture.<br>
                Whisk until well combined.</li>
            <li>Strain mixture through a fine sieve into a large measuring cup. Scrape vanilla bean to remove remaining seeds. Add seeds to custard and stir.</li>
            <li>Place a ten 4-ounce ramekins into a 2-inch deep roasting pan or baking dish. Pour creme brulee mixture into ramekins.</li>
            <li>Set baking pan into oven and carefully pour enough water into the pan till halfway up sides of ramekins.</li>
            <li>Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until custard no longer trembles.<br>
                Check early as baking time will depend on ramekin depth. Custard should be set, not soupy, with only a small jiggle in the center.</li>
            <li>When done, carefully remove from oven and allow ramekins to cool in the water bath.<br>
                When cool enough to handle, remove from water bath, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours to 2 days before serving.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, remove from refrigerator and sprinkle tops with 1/3 cup granulated sugar.<br>
                Immediately caramelize with a blow torch or under a broiler.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
